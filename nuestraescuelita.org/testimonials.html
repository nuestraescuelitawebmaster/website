Our daughter Magdalena is now in her 3rd school year attending Nuestra Escuelita, first in the 2 year old "Mommy and Me" Jardin program, then last year as a 3 year old in Pequenos, and now that she's 4 as one of the "Grandes"! We can't say enough about this fantastic parent-participation Spanish language preschool...if you're looking to maintain and enrich your children's Spanish language skills and want to be involved in your child's preschool education, while they make friends, have fun, and learn, then you can't beat Nuestra Escuelita!<br>

This is an awesome Spanish speaking preschool/ cooperative, run by  the kids' parents. 
The best ratio teacher-student! 
The kids have fun learning, the parents are fun!<br>

Excelente preescolar de participaci&oacute;n de padres, donde se habla &uacute;nicamente en espa&ntilde;ol. Yo tuve a mi hija en el ciclo escolar 2008-2009 y ahora tengo mi hijo en el grupo de los peque&ntilde;os (ni&ntilde;os de 3 a&ntilde;os).
Recomiendo Nuestra Escuelita a todas aquellas familias que deseen fortalecer el espa&ntilde;ol en sus hijos, involucrarse  de una forma activa en la educaci&oacute;n de ellos y formar una comunidad con gente hispanohablante.

Our family has been involved with Nuestra Escuelita since its beginning as a play group 10 years ago.  Nuestra Escuelita is the best preschool for Spanish speaking families who want to further immerse their kids in the rich cultural and language environment.  The most remarkable thing about the school is the sense of community that holds the families together.  The friends we have made there with our kids are our friends for life.  Nuestra Escuelita holds this wonderful place in the hearts of its families because of its commitment to parent involvement.   It is the only parent participation preschool in Spanish in the area.  When our littlest graduates next year, we will be very sad that there is not another child to enroll, and another reason to stay connected to this supportive community.

Nuestra Escuelita has been a wonderful experience for our son. He truly likes it and enjoys it. This is his second year there. We are very happy to be part of such as a wonderful community. Teachers and families are a great team that support our children's education.

Nuestro hijo ha estado en Nuestra Escuelita por dos a&ntilde;os y est&aacute; feliz en ella. Tenemos una maravillosa comunidad, maestras muy bien preparadas y todos juntos brindamos lo mejor para la educaci&oacute;n de nuestros hijos.

Our family is very happy with Nuestra Escuelita, a parent participation preschool, and all it has to offer our kids : Great teachers, low student -teacher  ratio, awesome curriculum, and of course the SPANISH  language.  My oldest started  in the "Jardin" program (Parent and Me), was in the "Peque&ntilde;os" preschool class 2 days a week last year  and currently is in the "Grandes" class 3 days a week.  My youngest is currently in the Jardin program and will be in the Peque&ntilde;os next school year. We enjoy being a part of this great SPANISH parent participation preschool and community!

We have two children currently enrolled in this preschool and it has been a great experience to be a part of this parent-participation school.  The teachers are wonderful, involved and caring and we have been very happy with the curriculum this year in "Los Peque&ntilde;os" ( 3yr. old classes).  "El Jardin" Mommy and Me program is a great way to get started if your child is 2 or under.  Both of our children have benefited greatly from their involvement in this school and I have been very happy to be part of a dedicated group of parents who are concerned about their childrens' education.

I have been very impressed with Nuestra Escuelita! It has taught my nephew great concepts and outstanding strategies and skills for his age. I thinik that Nuestra Escuelita is a great pre-school because it prepares students for kindergarten, and it allows them to practice and learn a new language!

This is great Spanish Immersion Preschool.  My daughter has been attending for three years now. The school offers programs for ages 0-5.  The teachers are great and native spanish speakers.  It is a parent run cooperative so parents have a say and are involved in their child's schooling.

Nuestra Escuelita is an excellent immersion spanish preschool. The  parents involved are very  nice and welcoming,and the teachers are very professional. I suggest you to looking into this preschool if you want your child to socialize and learn in their first language (Spanish). <br>

Nuestra Escuelita is the best Spanish language preschool in the area. This is a special place where your child will enhance and improve their Spanish speaking abilities, make long-lasting friendships and start their formal education experience in a positive way. In addition, because it is a parent participation preschool, it is a very special community of native Spanish speakers. I have made my closest friends through the preschool and have maintained these friendships long after my daughters have moved on to elementary school. Nuestra Escuelita definitely prepared my daughters for the two-way bilingual program in which they are now enrolled - academically, socially and developmentally. We highly recommend Nuestra Escuelita!<br>

This is my son's 2nd year at Nuestra Escuelita. This has been a fabulous experience for the whole family. The school offers warm, caring, and enriching environment, where both kids and parents get to learn and play together. It is the only truly Spanish immersion and parent participatnion, and parent-run school in the area. It has been successful for the past 10 years, and the community that's grown with and from it, is the best testimony to the dedication of its members! My son loves being there and he treats school as his second home. And we have made many great friends, there, too. Highly recommended.<br>
